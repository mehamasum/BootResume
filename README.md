BootRésumé
==========

What is BootRésumé?
-------------------
BootRésumé turns long winded, bullet heavy résumés into streamlined static webpages, highlighting your skills & accomplishments. All dependencies are pulled via CDN to minimize load time & page weight.

Because BR is built on Bootstrap 2.3.2 & Font Awesome, it's mobile ready out of the box and easy to modify.
