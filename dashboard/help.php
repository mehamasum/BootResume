                    position you are applying for. If for example, you are applying for a job as a Marketing Manager you
                    should not list a skill such as “breakdance” that is not relevant for this particular job. </p>

                        specific position in the ad. </p></li>
                    <li><p>Using industry or job specific skills in your résumé will enable your application to pass
                        through an applicant tracking system (ATS). </p></li>
                    <li><p>Search on the internet for the skills that are most needed in the industry you are applying
                        for a list the ones that you possess. </p></li>
                    <li><p>Include as well the “Soft Skills” that are demanded by almost all the jobs. E.g.:
                        Self-motivation, Communication, Time Management, Public Speaking, Leadership, Storytelling. </p>
